        My background in fashion design cultivated my creativity and taught me
        to thrive under pressure. It honed my skills in sewing, pattern making,
        and digital tools like Illustrator and Photoshop. This aesthetic
        sensibility and patience now drive my passion for creating beautiful and
        user-friendly websites.
