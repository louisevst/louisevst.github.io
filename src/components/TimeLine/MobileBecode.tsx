        Starting an exciting journey, I discovered web development at BeCode.
        From December 2022 to June 2023, I embraced the self-learning approach
        that BeCode is renowned forâ€”a dynamic, collaborative environment where
        we collectively grow through hands-on projects. I gained knowledge of
        foundational concepts like using a mobile first strategy, developing
        responsive websites, and considering modularity and scalability.
